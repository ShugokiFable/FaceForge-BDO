/**
 * Nothing here tries to turn a bad photo into a good one. It does two separate jobs:
 *
 *  - **Correct** what is geometrically recoverable. A tilted head is a 2D rotation and can be
 *    undone exactly. A turned or raised head foreshortens one axis by a cosine that can be
 *    divided back out. Left/right differences caused by pose are removed by mirror-averaging,
 *    which is safe because EFM sliders are bilateral -- Skyrim cannot express an asymmetric
 *    face anyway, so measuring one pose-biased side is strictly worse than averaging both.
 *
 *  - **Distrust** what is not recoverable. A smile genuinely widens the mouth and a blink
 *    genuinely closes the eye; no amount of maths recovers the neutral shape from one frame.
 *    Those measurements are faded toward the neutral baseline in proportion to how contaminated
 *    they are, so a grin becomes "mouth width unknown, left at default" instead of a character
 *    permanently grinning.
